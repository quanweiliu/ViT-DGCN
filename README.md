# Fusion of GaoFen-5 and Sentinel-2B data for lithological mapping using vision transformer dynamic graph convolutional network

## Run
If you want to run this code, just put your data in the Datasets folder and change a few paths.
- path_weight = "/home/leo/Oil_Spill_Detection/vitdgcn/weights/"
- path_result = "/home/leo/Oil_Spill_Detection/vitdgcn/result/"
- path_data = "/home/leo/DatasetSMD/"
and run
> python main.py
